This is a Hugo-based static website project designed to manage and display information about students and teachers. The site uses Hugo templates and YAML data files to render dynamic pages for student and teacher details.

Technology: Built with Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator.
Data Source: Student and teacher data is stored in data/students.yaml and data/teachers.yaml.
Hosted on: GitHub at https://github.com/dhengareharry/hugo_school_task.
